      to carry an {!Error.t} rather than a bare payload across the module's own boundary. This module is that pair, with
      the wrapper built at the throw and the catch guaranteed by construction.

      It is the companion of {!Err.protect}: [protect] absorbs an exception raised by {e foreign} code, while
      [with_escape] establishes an exit for the {e current} module's own recursion. *)

      Each call generates its own exception, so nested and concurrent uses cannot catch one another's escapes, and a
      throw aimed at an enclosing token passes through inner frames to the one that owns it. The return type is
      [('a, 'e) Err.t].

      No event is recorded here. [Catch] describes absorbing a foreign exception, and recording it would make an

(** {1 Binding a domain printer}

    Every operation above that can produce or convert an error takes [?pp_error], because the printer describes the
    payload domain that exists {e at that call}. A domain has exactly one printer, so supplying it at each call is
    repetitive; {!Make} supplies it once.

    The functor introduces no new types: [Make(D).fail] is [fail ~pp_error:D.pp_error], so bound and unbound values
    interoperate freely.

    It pays best in a module that mostly uses one error domain. Binding a printer fixes the operations obtained from
    {!Make} at that domain, so code that relies on [`Missing] inferring a smaller row before widening into several
    different domains may be clearer with the unbound operations -- or a plain function such as
    [let fail ?pos e = Err.fail ?pos ~pp_error e]. A printer written with a [[< error ]] argument is accepted by
    {!Make}; the resulting operations use the domain type supplied by the functor. *)
